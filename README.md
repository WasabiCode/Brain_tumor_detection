# Brain_tumor_detection

Hello I would like to present my newest Image classification model for Brain tumor detection. You need to install some dependencies like tensorflow, matplotlib or opencv, but in the file I included my virtual enviroment with all of the dependencies installed. Make sure to activate it. In the file you will also find my dataset from kaggle.
