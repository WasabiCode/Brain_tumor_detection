# Brain_tumor_detection

Hello I would like to present my newest Image classification model for Brain tumor detection. You need to install some dependencies like tensorflow, matplotlib or opencv, but in the file I included my virtual enviroment with all of the dependencies installed. Make sure to activate it.
Link for the training dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection
Use Yes/No folders
I also include the model, so if you want to skip training and just try it, you are more then welcome to do so.
